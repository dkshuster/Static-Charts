# Static-Charts

A collection of charts that use internal data vs. getting live data from Rally.  These charts are used to show trending or historical data this is difficult to do in a Rally demo environemnt.

These apps use the SDK and are based on Bare Metal Chart example in the SDK docs.

To change the data you will need to edit the embedded chart data in the app.js.  The chart can then be built using the Rally app builder process.  Or you can edit the data in the HTML version of the file without rebuilding.
